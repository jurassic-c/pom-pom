pom-pom
=======

A dead simple Pomodoro Timer for Ubuntu Unity Desktop. It doesn't track tasks. It doesn't have any options.
But it does put a timer in your notification area. When a work period or a break begins, a notification is
displayed and an alarm sounds. Every 4th Pomodoro, you get a 15 minute break.
